> Why is the particular topic chosen? 

Mentorship programs are common in various organizations, making the system applicable and valuable in professional settings. 
 Many organizations struggle with managing mentorship programs efficiently. Our system can address this need and streamline the process. 
 Developing such a system provides opportunities to work with various technologies and frameworks, enhancing our technical skills. 
 A well-designed system can positively impact the mentorship experience, fostering professional development and knowledge transfer within organizations. 
 As organizations grow, the need for effective mentorship programs increases. Your system can be scalable to accommodate the growth of the organization. 
 We can tailor the system to fit the specific requirements and preferences of different organizations, making it versatile and marketable. 
 We can explore and implement innovative features, such as AI-driven mentor matching algorithms or data analytics to measure the effectiveness of mentorship programs. 

> Objective and scope of the Project:

A mentor-mentee management system is essential for fostering personal and professional growth by providing guidance, support, and networking opportunities. It facilitates meaningful connections between experienced mentors and aspiring mentees to enhance skill development and career advancement. 
  	 
  A mentee is chosen based upon their attendance percentage, CGPA, SGPA. If a student has poor attendance and poor performance in the academics then those students are selected as mentee under a respective mentor.  
   
  The departmentâ€™s HOD chooses the faculty members from a respective department. Mentors and mentees belong from the same departments.  
   
  The selected mentees get an email from the Administration for a registration. 
   
  Mentors have the responsibility to provide guidance, support to the mentees. Mentor meets with mentee 2 times face to face in a month. The mentor manages an excel file as a report file. The report file contains the whole details of the mentees along with what has been discussed in a face-to-face meeting and what improvement has been observed by the mentor of the mentee.
